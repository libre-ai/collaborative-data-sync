/**
 * @libre-ai/collab-relay — Ciphertext-only relay server.
 *
 * A WebSocket relay that forwards sealed CRDT frames between members.
 * The relay is structurally incapable of decryption:
 * - Takes NO key material as input.
 * - NEVER decrypts frame contents (ciphertext remains opaque).
 * - NEVER logs plaintext or frame structure beyond what's needed for routing.
 * - Routes frames based on epoch and member ID only.
 *
 * Each member sends sealed frames containing their document deltas.
 * The relay broadcasts these frames to all other members in the same session,
 * unchanged and encrypted. Decryption happens only at the destination (if
 * the recipient is a member of the MLS group that encrypted the frame).
 *
 * Threat model
 * ------------
 * Confidentiality is out of the relay's hands by construction: it holds no key
 * and never decrypts. An operator with access to the frames learns only member
 * ID, epoch, and frame structure (nonce length, ciphertext size); the delta
 * contents stay unreadable without the MLS key.
 *
 * Availability and routing integrity ARE the relay's responsibility, because it
 * owns the session-to-connection map that decides who receives what. Every
 * mutation of that map is therefore bound to the connection requesting it: a
 * client may take a free slot, and may only release or send on a slot it holds
 * on its own socket. Without that binding any connected client could evict any
 * member of any session (targeted denial of service) or take over a member's
 * slot at join time and silently black-hole its traffic. Neither attack needs a
 * key, so the ciphertext-only design does not defend against them on its own.
 *
 * Binding those mutations also closes the path by which a third party used to
 * purge a slot the relay had failed to release, so the relay owns the release
 * itself: a disconnecting socket gives up EVERY slot it held, in every session,
 * and a session emptied that way is collected. Releasing only the first would
 * strand a routing entry on a closed socket and retain its session forever —
 * memory growth driven remotely, without a key, at one WebSocket and two frames
 * per session.
 *
 * Releasing what is finished is only half of it: a session is created by
 * whoever asks for one, so admission is capped as well. The routing map holds
 * at most `maxSessions` sessions of at most `maxMembersPerSession` slots, and a
 * join over either ceiling is refused with close code 1013 rather than served.
 * Without that cap the map grows as fast as a client can send frames, and no
 * amount of correct release helps.
 *
 * Not defended, deliberately:
 * - MLS group membership is NOT validated here. A client may hold a slot in a
 *   session whose frames it cannot decrypt; that check belongs at the
 *   destination, where the AEAD tag is verified.
 * - The `id` field inside a frame is not authenticated. It is routing metadata,
 *   not a claim of identity — recipients trust the AEAD tag, not this field.
 * - A *free* slot is first-come-first-served: the relay has no identity
 *   provider, so it cannot tell a legitimate member from a squatter claiming
 *   the memberId first. The guarantee stops at "a slot that is taken cannot be
 *   stolen, released, or sent on by a third party"; pre-emptive squatting
 *   remains possible and now surfaces as an explicit join refusal (1008)
 *   instead of a silent takeover.
 * - Admission is bounded, not fair. The ceilings cap what the routing map can
 *   hold in total; they do not stop one client from filling it and starving
 *   everybody else, because a client refused on one socket simply opens
 *   another and the relay has no identity to charge the quota to. Per-client
 *   fairness needs a rate limiter or an authenticated front end above this
 *   layer; the ceiling here only guarantees that the memory stops growing.
 * - Frame rate and frame size are not limited. A member holding a slot can
 *   spend the relay's bandwidth and its peers' attention freely; the routing
 *   map, which is what this file owns, stays bounded either way.
 *
 * Frame schema (opaque to relay):
 *   { id: string, epoch: number, nonce: Uint8Array, ciphertext: Uint8Array, tag: Uint8Array }

 *   { type: "join", sessionId: string, memberId: string }

 *   { type: "leave", sessionId: string, memberId: string }
